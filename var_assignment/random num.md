# 3.19 Random Numbers

## Generate random numbers
* `rand() in C standard library returns random integer each time
* Usually, a programmer wants a random integer restricted to a specific number of possible values. The modulo operator % can be used. Ex: integer % 10 has 10 possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   cout << rand() << endl;
   cout << rand() << endl;
   cout << rand() << endl;

   cout << "(RAND_MAX: " << RAND_MAX << ")" << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Specific Ranges
* The technique above generates random integers with N possible values ranging from 0 to N-1
* To adjust a different range, determine number of possible values and add x to adjust the range to start with x
  * Example: `(rand() % 6) + 10` does range 10 - 15
  * Example: `(rand() % (30-18+1)) + 18` 18 - 30
  * Example: `(rand() % 13) + -4; `-4 to 8
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

// Switch a student
// from a random seat on the left  (cols  1 to 15)
//   to a random seat on the right (cols 16 to 30)
// Seat rows are 1 to 20

int main() {
   int rowNumL;
   int colNumL;
   int rowNumR;
   int colNumR;

   rowNumL = (rand() % 20) + 1;  // 1 to 20
   colNumL = (rand() % 15) + 1;  // 1 to 15

   rowNumR = (rand() % 20) + 1;  // 1 to 20
   colNumR = (rand() % 15) + 16; // 16 to 30

   cout << "Move from ";
   cout << "row " << rowNumL << " col " << colNumL;
   cout << " to " ;
   cout << "row " << rowNumR << " col " << colNumR;
   cout << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Psuedo-random
* The integers generated by rand() are known as pseudo-random
  * each time a program runs, calls to rand() yield the same sequence of values.
*  For the first call to rand(), no previous random integer exists, so the function uses a built-in integer known as the `seed`. By default, the seed is 1
* One way to get a different seed for each program run is to use the current time as the seed. The function time() returns the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.
