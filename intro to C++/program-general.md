# 2.1 Programming (General)

## Computer Program Basics
* A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time
* Basic instructions are:
  * `Input`: Program gets data, from a file etc...
  * `Process`: Program performs computations on that data
  * `Output`: Program puts the data somewhere
* They use `variables` to refer to  the data
  * The name is due to the variable's value varying
```
x = 2
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
```
1. Basic Computer Instructions above, gets input, porcess, and put output. Assigns x with input
2. Assigns y with next input
3. Does processing, assigning z with x + y
4. Program outputs z
* A program is like a recipe

## Computational Thinking
* Mathematical thinking became important
* In this info age, `computational thinking` (create sequence of instructions to solve a problem) became improtant for work and life
* `Algorithm`: Sequence of instructions that solves a problem
