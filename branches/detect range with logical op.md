# 4.5 Detecting ranges using logical operators

## Logical AND, OR, and NOT (general)
* A `logical operator` treats operands as being true or false, and evaluates to true or false. Logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.

## Logical operators
* Special symbols are used to represent the AND, OR, and NOT logical operators. Logical operators are commonly used in expressions of if-else statements.

## Detecting ranges implicitly vs. explicitly
* A programmer often uses logical operators to detect a range by explicitly specifying the high-end and low-end of the range.
