# 4.13 String Comparisons

## String comparison: Equality
* Two strings are commonly compared for equality. Equal strings have the same number of characters, and each corresponding character is identical.

## String comparison: Relational
* Strings are sometimes compared relationally (less than, greater than), as when sorting words alphabetically.
* A comparison begins at index 0 and compares each character until the evaluation results in false, or the end of a string is reached.
* A programmer compares strings relationally using the relational operators <, <=, >, and >=.
