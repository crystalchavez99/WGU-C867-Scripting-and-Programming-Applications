# 4.1 If-Else Branch

## Branch Concept
*  `branch` is a sequence of statements only executed under a certain condition
*  `if` branch is a branch taken only if expresison is true

## If-Else
* `if-else` branch has two branches: first branch is executed `if expression is true`, `else expression` is executed

## If-elseif-else
* An if-else can be extended to an if-elseif-else structure. Each branch's expression is checked in sequence; as soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch is taken. If no expression is found true, execution will reach the else branch, which then executes.
