# 4.18  Floating-point comparison
* Floating-point numbers should not be compared using ==.
* Floating-point numbers should be compared for "close enough" rather than exact equality.
* The difference threshold indicating that floating-point numbers are equal is often called the `epsilon`
*  `fabs()` is a function in the math library.
