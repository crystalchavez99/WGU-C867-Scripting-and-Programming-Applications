# 5.2 While loops
* A `while loop` is a program construct that repeatedly executes a list of sub-statements (known as the loop body) while the loop's expression evaluates to true.
```C++
while (expression) { // Loop expression
    // Loop body: Executes if expression evaluated to true
    // After body, execution jumps back to the "while"
}
// Statements that execute after the expression evaluates to false
```

## Getting input before a loop
* Another common pattern gets that initial value from user input as well, thus getting input in two places: before the loop, and at the loop body's end.

## Loop expressions
* Various kinds of expressions are found in while loop expressions
* Sometimes a loop is executed as long as a value is NOT equal to another value.

## Common errors
* An `infinite loop` is a loop that never stops iterating.
